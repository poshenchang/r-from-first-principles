# Learning R through Data, Semantics, and Abstraction

This repository documents my hands-on study of the **R programming language**, inspired by the structure and philosophy of **CIS194 (Haskell)**.

Rather than treating R solely as a data analysis tool, I approach it as a *programming language* with a distinct evaluation model, scoping rules, and functional abstractions.

## Structure

- `r4ds/`  
  Practical fluency using *R for Data Science*, focusing on pipelines, tidy data, and reproducible analysis.

- `adv-r/`  
  A semantic and abstraction-oriented study following *Advanced R*, covering environments, lazy evaluation, metaprogramming, and performance.

- `mini-projects/`  
  Self-designed projects exploring:
  - functional programming patterns in R
  - copy-on-modify semantics and performance
  - algorithmic thinking and data structures

All work is done in **R Markdown** to emphasize reproducibility and clarity.

## Motivation

My background is in computer science and mathematics, with interests in algorithms and formal reasoning.  
This repository reflects an effort to understand how R’s design choices affect expressiveness, performance, and abstraction—especially in comparison with functional languages such as Haskell.

## Tools

- tidyverse
- purrr
- rlang
- bench
- lobstr
- renv for reproducibility
