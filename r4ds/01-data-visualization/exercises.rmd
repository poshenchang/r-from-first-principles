## Section 1.2 exercises

1.  How many rows are in `penguins`? How many columns?\
    A: 344 rows and 8 columns.

2.  What does the `bill_depth_mm` variable in the `penguins` data frame describe? Read the help for `?penguins` to find out.\
    A: a number denoting bill depth in millimeters.

3.  Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm`. That is, make a scatterplot with `bill_depth_mm` on the y-axis and `bill_length_mm` on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.\
    A: roughly a positive correlation within species.
    ```{r}
    #| warning: false
    ggplot(data = penguins, 
           mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
      labs(
        title = "Bill depth and bill length", 
        subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
        x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)"
      )
    ```

4.  What happens if you make a scatterplot of `species` vs. `bill_depth_mm`? What might be a better choice of geom?\
    A: 
    ```{r}
    #| warning: false
    ggplot(data = penguins, 
           mapping = aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) + 
      geom_density(mapping = aes(color = species))
    ```

5.  Why does the following give an error and how would you fix it?\
    A: the geom is missing aesthetics `x` and `y`.
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    #| warning: false
    ggplot(data = penguins) + 
      geom_point()
    ```

6.  What does the `na.rm` argument do in `geom_point()`? What is the default value of the argument? Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to `TRUE`.\
    A: this argument set to `TRUE` automatically removes `N/A` values.
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = penguins,
           mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
      geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species), na.rm = TRUE)
    ```

7.  Add the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise: "Data come from the palmerpenguins package." Hint: Take a look at the documentation for `labs()`.\
    A: captions are associated with the `caption` argument in `lab()`.
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = penguins,
           mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
      geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species, shape = species), na.rm = TRUE) + 
      labs(
        title = "Body mass and flipper length",
        subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
        caption = "Data come from the palmerpenguins package.", 
        x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
        color = "Species", shape = "Species"
      )
    ```

8.  Recreate the following visualization. What aesthetic should `bill_depth_mm` be mapped to? And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?\
    A: `bill_depth_mm` is mapped continuously to the color at the geom level.
    ```{r}
    #| warning: false
    #| fig-alt: |
    #|   A scatterplot of body mass vs. flipper length of penguins, colored 
    #|   by bill depth. A smooth curve of the relationship between body mass 
    #|   and flipper length is overlaid. The relationship is positive, 
    #|   fairly linear, and moderately strong.
    ggplot(
      data = penguins,
      mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
    ) +
      geom_point(aes(color = bill_depth_mm)) +
      geom_smooth()
    ```

9.  Run this code in your head and predict what the output will look like. Then, run the code in R and check your predictions.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(
      data = penguins,
      mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = island)
    ) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
    ```

10. Will these two graphs look different? Why/why not?\
    A: they're equivalent since the `mapping` argument in `ggplot()` is passed down to each subsequent geom layers.
    ```{r}
    ggplot(
      data = penguins,
      mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
    ) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth()

    ggplot() +
      geom_point(
        data = penguins,
        mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
      ) +
      geom_smooth(
        data = penguins,
        mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
      )
    ```

## Section 1.4 exercises

1.  Make a bar plot of `species` of `penguins`, where you assign `species` to the `y` aesthetic.
    How is this plot different?\
    A: the bars are displayed horizontally instead.
    ```{r}
    ggplot(penguins, aes(y = species)) +
      geom_bar()
    ```

2.  How are the following two plots different?
    Which aesthetic, `color` or `fill`, is more useful for changing the color of bars?\
    A: the `color` argument only changes the border of the bars, while the `fill` argument fills the bars with specified color.
    ```{r}
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
      geom_bar(color = "red")

    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
      geom_bar(fill = "red")
    ```

3.  What does the `bins` argument in `geom_histogram()` do?\
    A: specifies the number of bins the variable is partitioned into (as opposed to specifiying the width of each bin.)

4.  Make a histogram of the `carat` variable in the `diamonds` dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package.
    Experiment with different binwidths.
    What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?\
    A: `binwidth = 0.2` gives decent results.
    ```{r}
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) + 
      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, fill = "lightblue")
    ```

# Section 1.5 exercises

1.  The `mpg` data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package contains `r nrow(mpg)` observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on `r mpg |> distinct(model) |> nrow()` car models.
    Which variables in `mpg` are categorical?
    Which variables are numerical?
    (Hint: Type `?mpg` to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run `mpg`?

2.  Make a scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ` using the `mpg` data frame.
    Next, map a third, numerical variable to `color`, then `size`, then both `color` and `size`, then `shape`.
    How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical variables?\
    A: continuous variables cannot be mapped to the `shape` aesthetic.
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, 
           mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty, size = cty)) +
      geom_point()
    ```

3.  In the scatterplot of `hwy` vs. `displ`, what happens if you map a third variable to `linewidth`?\
    A: nothing happens.
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = mpg, 
           mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linewidth = cty)) +
      geom_point()
    ```

4.  What happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?\
    A: then it corresponds to multiple aesthetics, as shown in exercise 1.5.2.

5.  Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm` and color the points by `species`.
    What does adding coloring by species reveal about the relationship between these two variables?
    What about faceting by `species`?\
    A: as shown in exercise 1.2.3, there's roughly a positive correlation within each species.
    ```{r}
    #| warning: false
    ggplot(data = penguins, 
           mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
      geom_point() +
      geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
      labs(
        title = "Bill depth and bill length", 
        subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
        x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)"
      ) +
      facet_wrap(~species)
    ```

6.  Why does the following yield two separate legends?
    How would you fix it to combine the two legends?

    ```{r}
    #| warning: false
    #| fig-show: hide
    ggplot(
      data = penguins,
      mapping = aes(
        x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
        color = species, shape = species
      )
    ) +
      geom_point() +
      labs(color = "Species")
    ```
    A: they're separated since the legend is only specified for one. Below is the fixed version of the plot.
    ```{r}
    #| warning: false
    ggplot(
      data = penguins,
      mapping = aes(
        x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, 
        color = species, shape = species
      )
    ) +
      geom_point() +
      labs(color = "Species", shape = "Species")
    ```

7.  Create the two following stacked bar plots.
    Which question can you answer with the first one?
    Which question can you answer with the second one?\
    A: They show the proportion of the different species on each island and the distribution on the islands of each species respectively.
    ```{r}
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) +
      geom_bar(position = "fill")
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = island)) +
      geom_bar(position = "fill")
    ```
    
## Section 1.6 exercises

1.  Run the following lines of code.
    Which of the two plots is saved as `mpg-plot.png`?
    Why?\
    A: the latter one, as `ggsave()` defaults to fetching the last plot generated.
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
      geom_bar()
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point()
    ggsave("mpg-plot.png")
    ```

2.  What do you need to change in the code above to save the plot as a PDF instead of a PNG?
    How could you find out what types of image files would work in `ggsave()`?\
    A: simply changing the file extension would work, or formally, one specifies `device` as one of "png", "eps", "ps", "tex" (pictex), "pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "png", "bmp", "svg" or "wmf" (windows only). If NULL (default), the device is guessed based on the filename extension.
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
      geom_point()
    ggsave("mpg-plot.pdf")
    ```
